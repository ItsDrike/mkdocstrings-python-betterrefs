This package provides an extended version of the [standard python handler][mkdocstrings_python]
for [mkdocstrings] that provides the following additional features:

* [relative cross-references](relative-crossref.md) allows you to write
    cross-reference paths compactly relative to the item it documents.

Some of these features may eventually find their way into the official python handler.
